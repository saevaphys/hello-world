<p>These are the locations, which you analyzed, with results of the annual energy increase for a Single Axis Tracking (SAT) system vs Fixed Plate solar energy system. The percentages displayed include a small effect due to variations in atmospheric turbidity. <strong>In general, cities located closer to the equator have a greater benefit from SAT solar energy systems versus Fixed Plate systems, compared with cities located in northern or southern latitudes further from the equator.<br /></strong></p>

<p><em>Because some cities are located relatively close to each other, the interactive map is a good way to explore these analysis results. Using the static map, below, where percentage increase is indicated by a color bar, it becomes difficult to read in places where many cities cluster together:</em></p>
