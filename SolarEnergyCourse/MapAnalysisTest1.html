    <h1>Summary of Clear Sky Results for Year 2020</h1>
	<p>These are the locations, which you analyzed, for the annual energy increase of a Single Axis Tracking (SAT) system vs Fixed Plate solar energy system. The percentages displayed include a small effect due to variations in atmospheric turbidity. <strong>In general, cities located closer to the equator have a greater benefit from SAT solar energy systems versus Fixed Plate systems, compared with cities located in northern or southern latitudes further from the equator.<br /></strong></p>
	<p><em>Note that because some cities are located relatively close to each other, an interactive map is a good way to explore the analysis results. Using a static map, where the percentage increases are indicated by a color bar, it is difficult to compare the results in locations where many cities are clustered together:</em></p>
